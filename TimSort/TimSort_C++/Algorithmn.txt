TimSort is a sorting algorithm based on Insertion Sort and Merge Sort.
The idea is based on the fact that insertion sort performs well for small arrays.

Firstly, small pieces are sorted using Insertion Sort, then they are merged using the 
Merge algorithm of Merge Sort.
The array is divided into blocks known as RUN which are sorted using Insertion Sort
one by one and then merged. 
The size of RUN may vary between 32 and 64 depending upon the size of the array. 
If the size of array is less than RUN, then array get sorted just by Insertion Sort. 
The merge function performs well when sizes subarrays are powers of 2. 
This algorithm works in O(n Log n) time.

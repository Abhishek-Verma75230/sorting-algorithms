# Sorting Algorithms

A collection of different types of sorting algorithms in diff languages.
This repository is open to all. 
To help you out with you Hacktoberfest goals!!.
All you need to do is just add any sorting algorithm of your choice in any language you like with only the condition that it hasn't already been added.

## Guidelines

- Create a  folder with the algorithm name and language used to implement it. ( Eg: Insertion Sort-C++ )
- Add a .txt file with the Algorithm and a solution file which contains the solution of the given problem.

## Steps

- Fork this repo (button on top)
- Star this repo (button on top)
- Clone on your local machine

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms.git
```

- Create a new folder with the algorithm name and language.
- Add your algorithm and solution file in that folder. 
- Commit and push

```markdown
git add .
git commit -m 'Added algorithm-name'
git push origin master
```

- Create a new pull request from your forked repository
- And you are one step closer!

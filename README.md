# Sorting Algorithms

A collection of different types of sorting algorithms in diff languages.
This repository is open to all. 
To help you out with you Hacktoberfest goals!!.
All you need to do is just add any sorting algorithm of your choice in any language you like with only the condition that it hasn't already been added.

## Guidelines

- Create a  folder with the algorithm name and language used to implement it. ( Eg: Insertion Sort-C++ )
- Add a .txt file with the Algorithm and a solution file which contains the solution of the given problem.
- Add this file inside the folder with the name of the algorithm you have implemented. If not present then create a new folder with the name of the algorithm and add your own folder to it.
- You can also help maintain a single text file containing the detailed explanation of all the algorithms.

Since we restructured it,it does not contain a single file for the algorithm.

## Steps

- Fork this repo (button on top)
- Star this repo (button on top)
- Clone on your local machine

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms.git
```

- Create a new folder with the algorithm name and language.
- Add your algorithm and solution file in that folder. 
- Commit and push

```markdown
git add .
git commit -m 'Added algorithm-name'
git push origin master
```

- Create a new pull request from your forked repository
- And you are one step closer!

Idea for some other algorithms are :

- Radix Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- 3-way Merge Sort

Radix Sort
The lower bound for Comparison based sorting algorithm (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Ω(nLogn), i.e., they cannot do better than nLogn.
Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that sort in O(n+k) time when elements are in range from 1 to k.

The Radix Sort Algorithm
1) Do following for each digit i where i varies from least significant digit to the most significant digit.
………….a) Sort input array using counting sort (or any stable sort) according to the i’th digit.

Example:
Original, unsorted list:

170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66
Sorting by least significant digit (1s place) gives: [*Notice that we keep 802 before 2, because 802 occurred before 2 in the original list, and similarly for pairs 170 & 90 and 45 & 75.]

170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66


 

Sorting by next digit (10s place) gives: [*Notice that 802 again comes before 2 as 802 comes before 2 in the previous list.]

802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90
Sorting by most significant digit (100s place) gives:

2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802

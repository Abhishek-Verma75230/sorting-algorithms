Introsort or Introspective sort is the generic sorting algorithm used in the C++ standard library.
It is a hybrid sorting algorithm that uses Insertion sort, Quick sort and Heap sort to maximize efficiency.

Even though quicksort is a pretty efficient algorithm for sorting an array, 
it approaches O(N2) in the worst case, so we switch to either heap sort (when the size is too big) 
or insertion sort (when the size is too small) to make it an around efficient algorithm.

Pigeonhole sorting is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting lists of elements where the number of elements and the number of possible key values are approximately the same.
It's similar to counting sort, but differs in that it move items twice: once to the bucket array and again to the final destination.

Algorithm:
1. Find the minimum and the maximum values in array.
2. Find the range described as max-min+1.
3. Set up an array of initially empty "pigeonholes" the same size as the range.
4. Visit each element of the array and then put each element in its pigeonhole. An element arr[i] is put in hole at index arr[i]-min.
5. Loop over pigeonhole array in order and put the elements from non-empty holes back into the original.

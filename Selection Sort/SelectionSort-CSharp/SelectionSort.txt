Basic program that uses a predefined vector with the size 
of 10000 integers, sorting them using the selection sort 
and printing the vector.

In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, 
specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, 
making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse 
than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, 
and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, 
particularly where auxiliary memory is limited. (Wikipedia)

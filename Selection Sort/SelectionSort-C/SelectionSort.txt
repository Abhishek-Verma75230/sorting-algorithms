Basic program to ask a user for the size
of an array they want to input, and then ask them for
the numbers they want stored in the array. The program
then prints those numbers in a sorted list, using
selection sort to do the sort.

Selection sort is implemented differently from bubble sort
in that a minimum index position must be identified within
the nested for loops (i = min_ind), so that elements
can continuously be compared to a minimum value stored in
the first index of the sorted portion of the list. This
is how selection sort makes its comparisons.

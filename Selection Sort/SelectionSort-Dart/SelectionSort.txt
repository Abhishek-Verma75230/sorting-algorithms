This program implements selection sort in Dart. 
Selection sort is one of the most basic and naive ways to sort an array, but is also one of the slowest, running in O(n^2) time.

The algorithm goes through the list repeatedly and finds the minimum value in the array through each pass.
It then swaps this minimum value with the current index in the loop, effectively building up the list from the minimum value through each pass.

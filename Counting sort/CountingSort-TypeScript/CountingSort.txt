Counting Sort

The Counting sort is a simple algorithm which is based on the occurrence of a value.

Take an example with an array of int :
array = [5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5]

1) The first step is to create a table with the occurrence of each number.
'array' contains :
1 occurence of 1
1 occurence of 2
2 occurence of 3
0 occurence of 4
2 occurence of 5
So in the created table we have :
array = [1, 1, 2, 0, 2]

2) The hardest thing is done ! It remains to create an array with the number of values
contained in each index with the value of the index.

sortArray = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5]

Ta-dam ! It's done

It's runtime is O(n)

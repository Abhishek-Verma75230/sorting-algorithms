Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
The efficiency The main advantage of Bubble Sort is the simplicity of the algorithm. 
The space complexity for Bubble Sort is O(1), because only a single additional memory space is required i.e. for temp variable. 
Also, the best case time complexity will be O(n), it is when the list is already sorted.

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering 
of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. 
Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

The implementation for Topological Sort/Toplogical_Sort_Java/TopologicalSort.java
is based on Depth First Search.

Please note that the directed acyclic graph implemented in 
Topological Sort/Toplogical_Sort_Java/TopologicalSort.java
looks like this:

 5 ------> 0 <-------- 4
 |                     |
 |                     |
 |                     |
\|/                   \|/
 *                     *
 2 ------> 3 --------> 1

Problems:
I have given a list of numbers but it is not sorted

The numbers are
[5, 7, 10, 4, 1, 8, 11, 14, 6, 2, 17, 14, 3, 9, 20, 13, 18]

and in the solution file I'll write how to sort it with Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

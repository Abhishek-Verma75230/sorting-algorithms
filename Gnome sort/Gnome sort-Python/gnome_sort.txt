"""
Gnome Sort is based on the technique used by the standard Dutch Garden Gnome.

Here is how a garden gnome sorts a line of flower pots.
Basically, he looks at the flower pot next to him and the previous one; if they are in the right order he steps one pot forward, otherwise, he swaps them and steps one pot backward.

Boundary conditions: if there is no previous pot, he steps forwards; if there is no pot next to him, he is done.

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. 
It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

Always pick first element as pivot(implemented in the program).
Always pick last element as pivot.
Pick a random element as pivot.
Pick median as pivot.

In the main() function, first the initial array is displayed. 
Then, the function quickSort() is called to perform quick sort on the array.
In the function quickSort(), a pivot element is selected by calling the Partition() function. 
Then quickSort() is called again with arguments that depend on the value of pivot. 
In the Partition() function, the pivot element is selected as the leftmost element of the array provided 
and then it is set to its correct position in the array.

Tree sort is an online sorting algorithm that builds a binary search tree from the elements to be sorted, and then traverses the tree (in-order) so that the elements come out in sorted order.

Steps:

Step 1: Take the elements input in an array.
Step 2: Create a Binary search tree by inserting data items from the array into the binary searh tree.
Step 3: Perform in-order traversal on the tree to get the elements in sorted order.

Complexity : 
Worst case time complexity: Θ(N log N) using balanced binary search tree; Θ(N^2) using unbalanced binary search tree.
Average case time complexity: Θ(N log N)
Best case time complexity: Θ(N log N)
Space complexity: Θ(N).
